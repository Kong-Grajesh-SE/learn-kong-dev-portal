# Bookstore API Spec

::: tip This is the API you'll publish to your Developer Portal
The Bookstore API is a fictional API backed by **httpbun.com** (an HTTP echo service). You don't need to run a backend - httpbun echoes every request back so you can focus on portal setup, app registration, and customization.
:::

## Quick test with curl

Since the backend is httpbun (echo service), these requests will return echoed request data, not real book data:

```bash
# List books (echoed GET)
curl -s https://httpbun.com/books | jq .

# Create a book (echoed POST)
curl -s -X POST https://httpbun.com/books \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "The Great Gatsby", "author": "F. Scott Fitzgerald"}' | jq .
```
